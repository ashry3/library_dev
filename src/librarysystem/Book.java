                    + "He took a large swig of whiskey and instantly regretted it.  He was already on that fine line between drunk and downright paralytic.  So much so, he had been amazed at how efficiently he had processed mister no bags, getting the right room key and everything.  Drunken muscle memory he mused, as he focused as best he could on the small TV until the room stopped spinning.\n"

                    + "As he closed his eyes again, he could see the chimes in his mind’s eye, and beyond that an open window with bright sunlight flooding through half opened billowing curtains, as if touched by a light breeze.  He remembered drifting towards the window and the closer he got, the louder and harsher the screaming became.\n"

                    + "“Christ,” he cursed softly and went through into the room’s small bathroom and splashed cold water on his face in hopes if washing the nightmare away.\n"

You can't be certain of being still here tomorrow and so, you want to try out every crazy experience life can offer.

                    + "The drum beat kept a time which was easy for an oarsman to follow, even one as new to the task as me, and we slipped round the maze of canals at a steady pace. The city is a good walk from the sea but the main channel is wide, straight and deep and the ship made it with no alarms. Once out in open water we shipped our oars,the crew hoisted our sail and the helmsman set a course round the island and across the true ocean, for that was where 'Gate of the Sun' was bound.\n"

I'm not a young man any more and I've worked in metals all my life, and it's thirty summers or more since I began my apprenticeship. Now I flee for my life.\n"

                    + "I started the usual way, casting the rough blocks of metal into the blades of swords, for the hands of the more expert craftsmen, who heated and hammered them into shape, so that the metal took an edge. As I became a more expert craftsman myself I began to specialise in finer work. I set up alone, making lamps for homes and temples, thuribles and containers for incense, carefully hammered into shape and all of them delicately decorated.\n"

                    + "In later years I have had time to experiment with other ores, heating them and noting the effects. The ones that melted easily I tried mixing and working. I found some which were too soft for swords but good for jewellery; some I decorated with painted clay and heated again, and others were very tough and took a fine edge. I never had a mate. I lived alone and metals were my life and my hobby - I think that's why I became so skilled.\n"

No matter: I slowly, carefully, thoroughly, angrily called down the wrath of the gods upon that corrupt little man and his overweaning, usurping, insidious power I had fled to escape. I cursed him to his doom.\n"

The sky began to fill with the smoke of a great volcano far astern and the sea became an uneasy calm. There was a kind of greasy swell, like dirty water when you cool heated metal in it. Then a great wind came and we drove before it: a hot and fiery wind and the ship sped over the water, hastened by that fierce furnace of a blast. But fast as we travelled we could see a great wave coming towards us even faster. A wave like a great and towering cliff. A wall of water many mastheads high.\n"

I could revive with vivid reality all the incidents of our voyage, Iceland, M. Fridrikssen, Snæfell. I said to myself that if, in such a position as I was now in, I was fool enough to cling to one glimpse of hope, it would be madness, and that the best thing I could do was to despair.\n"
